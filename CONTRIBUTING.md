## Commit Message Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

We use an adapted form of [Conventional Commits](http://conventionalcommits.org/).

* Use the present tense ("Adds feature" not "Added feature")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Add one feature per commit. If you have multiple features, have multiple commits.

### Template

    <type>: Short Description of Commit
    <BLANKLINE>
    More detailed description of commit
    <BLANKLINE>
    (Optional) Resolves: <Issue #>

### Template for specific package change

    <type>[<package-name>]: Short Description of Commit
    <BLANKLINE>
    More detailed description of commit
    <BLANKLINE>
    (Optional) Resolves: <Issue #>

### Type
Our types include:
* `feat` when creating a new feature
* `fix` when fixing a bug
* `test` when adding tests
* `refactor` when improving the format/structure of the code
* `docs` when writing docs
* `release` when pushing a new release
* `chore` others (ex: upgrading/downgrading dependencies)


### Example

    docs: Updates CONTRIBUTING.md

    Updates Contributing.md with new emoji categories
    Updates Contributing.md with new template

    Resolves: #1234

### Example for specific package change
    fix[oidc-middleware]: Fixes bad bug

    Fixes a very bad bug in oidc-middleware

    Resolves: #5678

### Breaking changes

* Breaking changes MUST be indicated at the very beginning of the body section of a commit. A breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text `BREAKING CHANGE`, followed by a colon and a space.
* A description MUST be provided after the `BREAKING CHANGE:`, describing what has changed about the API.

### Example for a breaking change

    feat: Allows provided config object to extend other configs

    BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
