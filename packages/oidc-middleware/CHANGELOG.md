# 2.1.0

### Features

- Support for Org Authorization Servers. [#590](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/pull/590) - See [composing your base url](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#composing-your-base-url) for more information on Authorization Servers.

### Bug Fixes
- Errors during logout would cause the user to receive an empty page and remain logged in. [#585](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/pull/585) - 

  Due to this bug, errors during logout were being incorrectly suppressed and would not have been seen by the server process. Instead, the user would see a blank page. With this fix, the user will be logged out correctly, but the error event will also now be emitted to the server process.

  Your server code should be prepared to either log or ignore this error.

# 2.0.0

### Features

- [`a4b54f7`](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/commit/a4b54f771e19f2eeece46a39ded135550061f2a1) - adds Okta logout capability

- [`a999b95`](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/commit/a999b959c98bfea2f138281b2f93efb2d2d5fac7) - adds appBaseUrl, removes redirect_uri

- Adds Okta logout capability (informing Okta that the session is ended rather than just locally forgetting the current session) ([#162](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/issues/162))

### Breaking Changes 

See "Updating" in the README for migration steps

- `redirect_uri` config option is dropped.  The value is either automatically derived from the `appBaseUrl` and the appropriate `routes` option, or explicitly set as `loginRedirectUri`
- Two new routes are automatically generated and will override manually created routes of the same path.  Unless `routes` is customized, they are `/logout` (POST only) and `/logout/callback`
- `routes.callback` is renamed to `routes.loginCallback`
- `routes.callback.defaultRedirect` is renamed to `routes.loginCallback.afterCallback`

# 1.0.0

### Features

- Attach the requested tokens to the user context object ([#226](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/issues/226))

  ```javascript
  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    if (req.userContext) {
      const tokenSet = req.userContext.tokens;
      const userinfo = req.userContext.userinfo;

      console.log(`Access Token: ${tokenSet.access_token}`);
      console.log(`Id Token: ${tokenSet.id_token}`);
      console.log(`Claims: ${tokenSet.claims}`);
      console.log(`Userinfo Response: ${userinfo}`);

      res.send(`Hi ${userinfo.sub}!`);
    } else {
      res.send('Hi!');
    }
  });
  ```

- Basic configuration validation for catching common input mistakes.

### Breaking Changes

- `req.userinfo` is now nested within `req.userContext` ([#226](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/issues/226)). Please update any use of `req.userinfo` to `req.userContext.userinfo`.
