# 2.0.0

[#690](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/pull/690)

### Features

- `OktaCallbackComponent` will catch and display exceptions thrown from `handleAuthentication()`
- `onAuthRequired` callbacks will now receive the Angular injector as the 2nd parameter. This change allows logic using any services available within your application.

### Bug Fixes

- Saved URI is now stored in `sessionStorage` instead of `localStorage`. This fixes an issue which can occur when multiple instances of the app are loading at the same time.
- `OktaCallbackComponent` uses `window.location.replace()` to complete the login flow after `handleAuthentication` completes. This fixes an issue where the user could navigate back to the callback hander.

### Breaking Changes

- Signature for `onAuthRequired` callback functions has changed. Callbacks will receive the `OktaAuthService` as the first argument, and the Angular `Injector` as the second argument.
- Static initializer `OktaAuthModule.initAuth()` has been removed. `OKTA_CONFIG` should be provided directly by your module.
- `getFromUri` now returns an absolute URI as a string
- `setFromUri` takes a string. If it is a relative path, it will be converted to an absolute URI before being saved.
- Legacy config formats are no longer supported. See [Configuration Reference](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#configuration-reference) for supported values.
- The `pkce` option now defaults to `true`, using the Authorization Code w/PKCE flow
  - Those using the (previous default) Implicit Flow should pass `pkce: false` to their config
  - See the [@okta/okta-auth-js README regarding PKCE OAuth2 Flow](https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#pkce-oauth-20-flow) for PKCE requirements
    - Which include the Application settings in the Okta Admin Dashboard allowing for PKCE
