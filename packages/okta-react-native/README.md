The Okta React Native library makes it easy to add authentication to your React Native app. This library is a wrapper around [Okta OIDC Android](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-android) and [Okta OIDC iOS](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-ios).

This library follows the current best practice for native apps using:

* [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1)
* [Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)

## Prerequisites

* If you do not already have a **Developer Edition Account**, you can create one at [https://developer.okta.com/signup/](https://developer.okta.com/signup/).
* If you don't have a React Native app, or are new to React Native, please continue with the [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) guide. It will walk you through the creation of a React Native app and other application development essentials.
* If you are developing with an Android device emulator, make sure to check out the [React Native - Android Development](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#android-development-environment) setup instructions.

## Add an OpenID Connect Client in Okta

In Okta, applications are OpenID Connect clients that can use Okta Authorization servers to authenticate users.  Your Okta Org already has a default authorization server, so you just need to create an OIDC client that will use it.

* Log into the Okta Developer Dashboard, click **Applications** then **Add Application**.
* Choose **Native** as the platform, then submit the form the default values, which should look similar to this:

| Setting             | Value                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| App Name            | My Native App                                |
| Login redirect URIs | com.mynativeapp:/                            |
| Grant Types Allowed | Authorization Code, Refresh Token            |

After you have created the application there are two more values you will need to gather:

| Setting       | Where to Find                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Client ID     | In the applications list, or on the "General" tab of a specific application.   |
| Org URL       | On the home screen of the developer dashboard, in the upper right.             |

**Note:** *As with any Okta application, make sure you assign Users or Groups to the OpenID Connect Client. Otherwise, no one can use it.*

These values will be used in your React application to setup the OpenID Connect flow with Okta.

## Getting started

This library is available through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-react-native). To install it, simply add it to your project:

```
$ npm install @okta/okta-react-native --save
$ react-native link @okta/okta-react-native
```

Perform the following Manual installation steps if you're not using `react-native link`.

#### Manual installation (Optional)

##### iOS

1. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `@okta/okta-react-native` and add `ReactNativeOktaSdkBridge.xcodeproj`
3. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libReactNativeOktaSdkBridge.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
4. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)<

##### Android

1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`
  - Add `import com.oktareactnative.OktaSdkBridgePackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
  - Add `new OktaSdkBridgePackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method
2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
    ```
    include ':@okta/okta-react-native'
    project(':@okta/okta-react-native').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@okta/okta-react-native/android')
    ```
3. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
    ```
    compile project(':@okta_okta-react-native')
    ```

### iOS Setup

To setup iOS, there are three steps that you must take.

1. [Make sure your iOS app's deployment target is `11.0` and above.](#set-ios-deployment-target)
2. [Install Okta Open ID Connect iOS.](#install-okta-open-id-connect-ios)
3. [Make sure you also configure Swift.](#swift-configuration)

#### Set iOS Deployment Target

This library supports iOS version `11.0` and above. Go to your project -> `Build settings` -> `iOS Deployment Target`, and set it to at least version `11.0`.  

#### Install Okta Open ID Connect iOS
This library depends on the native [Okta OIDC iOS](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-ios) library. It is not distributed as part of the React Native library to keep your dependency management consistent. 

You can currently add Okta OIDC iOS through CocoaPods:

1. [**CocoaPods**]((https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html))

   ***React Native >= 0.60***: With React Native 0.60 pods are added to podfile automatically. Run `pod install` command to install dependecies:
   ```
   cd ios
   pod install
   ```
   ***React Native < 0.60***: Make sure your `Podfile` looks like this:
    ```   
   platform :ios, '11.0'

   target '{YourTargetName}' do

   pod 'OktaOidc', '~> 3.0'

   end
   ```

   Then run `pod install`.
   
2. **Carthage**
   With [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), add the following line to your Cartfile:

    ```
    github "okta/okta-oidc-ios" ~> 3.5.0
    ```
   Then run `carthage update --platform iOS`.

   Open project settings and choose your application target. Then open `Build Phases` and add `OktaOidc.framework` from `ios/Carthage/Build/iOS` into `Embed Frameworks` section
   
#### Swift Configuration
Since React Native uses Objective-C, and Okta React Native library is a Swift wrapper, you will need to have at least one Swift file in your iOS project for the project to compile. To add a dummy Swift file, follow the following steps:

1. Right click on your project, then `New file`.
2. Select `Swift file`, enter a title, and save.
3. If prompted for a header file, it is not required to create one.
4. Go to `Build Settings`, look for `Swift Compiler - Language`, set `Swift Language Version` to `4.2`.

If you're getting Swift linker issues, try adding this line to your project's library search path:
```
  $(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)
```

### Android Setup

For Android, there are two steps that you must take:
1. [Installing Okta Open Id Connect Android.](#install-okta-open-id-connect-android)
2. [Add a redirect scheme to your project.](#add-redirect-scheme)

#### Install Okta Open ID Connect Android
This library depends on the native [Okta OIDC Android](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-android) library. You have to add this library through Gradle. Follow the following steps:

1. Add this line to `android/build.gradle`, under `allprojects` -> `repositories`.
    ```
    maven {
      url  "https://dl.bintray.com/okta/com.okta.android"
    }
    ```
    
2. Make sure your `minSdkVersion` is `19` in `android/build.gradle`.

#### Add redirect scheme

Defining a redirect scheme to capture the authorization redirect. In `android/app/build.gradle`, under `android` -> `defaultConfig`, add:
```
manifestPlaceholders = [
  appAuthRedirectScheme: 'com.sampleapplication'
]
```

## Usage

You will need the values from the OIDC client that you created in the previous step to set up. You will also need to know your Okta Org URL, which you can see on the home page of the Okta Developer console.

Before calling any other method, it is important that you call `createConfig` to set up the configuration properly on the native modules.

Importing methods would follow this pattern: 

```javascript
import { createConfig, signIn, signOut, getAccessToken } from '@okta/okta-react-native';
```

### `createConfig`

This method will create a configured client on the native modules. Resolves `true` if successfully configures a client. Note: `requireHardwareBackedKeyStore` is a configurable setting only on android devices. If you're a developer testing on android emulators, set this field to `false`. 

```javascript
await createConfig({
  clientId: "{clientId}",
  redirectUri: "{redirectUri}",
  endSessionRedirectUri: "{endSessionRedirectUri}",
  discoveryUri: "https://{yourOktaDomain}",
  scopes: ["openid", "profile", "offline_access"],
  requireHardwareBackedKeyStore: true
});
``` 

### `signIn`

This async method will automatically redirect users to your Okta organziation for authentication. It will emit an event once a user successfully signs in. Make sure your event listeners are mounted and unmounted. Note: on iOS there isn't a `onCancelled` event. If the sign in process is cancelled, `onError` will be triggered. 

```javascript
signIn();
```

##### Sample Usage

```javascript
import { signIn, EventEmitter } from '@okta/okta-react-native';

componentDidMount() {
  this.signInSuccess = EventEmitter.addListener('signInSuccess', function(e: Event) {
    console.log(e.access_token);
    // Do something ...
  });
  this.signOutSuccess = EventEmitter.addListener('signOutSuccess', function(e: Event) {
    //...
  });
  this.onError = EventEmitter.addListener('onError', function(e: Event) {
    //...
  });
  this.onCancelled = EventEmitter.addListener('onCancelled', function(e: Event) {
    //...
  });
}

componentWillUnmount() {
  this.signInSuccess.remove();
  this.signOutSuccess.remove();
  this.onError.remove();
  this.onCancelled.remove();
}

``` 

### `authenticate`

If you already logged in to Okta and have a valid session token, you can complete authorization by calling `authenticate` method. It will emit an event once a user successfully signs in. Make sure your event listeners are mounted and unmounted. Note: on iOS there isn't a `onCancelled` event. If the `authenticate` process is cancelled, `onError` will be triggered. 

```javascript
authenticate({sessionToken: sessionToken});
```

### `signOut`

Clear the browser session and clear the app session (stored tokens) in memory. Fires an event once a user successfully logs out. For sample usage, refer to `signIn`.

```javascript
signOut();
```

### `isAuthenticated`

Returns a promise that resolves to `true` if there is a valid access token or ID token. Otherwise `false`.

```javascript
await isAuthenticated();
```

##### Sample Response

If authenticated: 

```javascript
{
  "authenticated": true
}
```

Else:
```javascript
{
  "authenticated": false
}
```


### `getAccessToken`

This method returns a promise that will return the access token as a string. If no access token is available (either does not exist, or expired), then the promise will be rejected.

```javascript
await getAccessToken();
```

##### Sample Response

If an access token is available:

```javascript
{
  "access_token": "{accessToken}"
}
```

### `getIdToken`

This method returns a promise that will return the identity token as a string. The promise will be rejected if no id token is available. 

```javascript
await getIdToken();
```

##### Sample Response

If an id token is available:

```javascript
{
  "id_token": "{idToken}"
}
```

### `getUser`

Returns a promise that will fetch the most up-to-date user claims from the [OpenID Connect `/userinfo`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oidc#userinfo) endpoint.

```javascript
await getUser();
```

##### Sample Response

If a user is available:

```javascript
{
  "sub": "00uid4BxXw6I6TV4m0g3",
  "name" :"John Doe",
  "nickname":"Jimmy",
  "given_name":"John",
  "middle_name":"James",
  "family_name":"Doe",
  "profile":"https://example.com/john.doe",
  "zoneinfo":"America/Los_Angeles",
  "locale":"en-US",
  "updated_at":1311280970,

  "phone_number":"+1 (425) 555-1212"
}
```

### `getUserFromIdToken`

Returns the user claims decoded from the identity token.

```javascript
await getUserFromIdToken();
```

##### Sample Response

Sample user claims:

```javascript
{
  "sub": "00uid4BxXw6I6TV4m0g3", 
  "name": "John Doe", 
  "preferred_username": "john.doe@example.com"
  "ver": 1, 
  "iss": "https://dev-example.okta.com", 
  "aud": "00uid4BxXw6I6TV4m0g3",
  "auth_time": 1561679776,
